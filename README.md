## 1. Measuring performance

Google is the most used search engine worldwide and [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) is the main tool provided by google to measure website performance. Google created [Page Speed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) that uses Lighthouse to measure your webpage performance and displays the results structured on sections as per image below.
> Explaining each section is beyond the scope of this documentation, if you want to read further, you can read [this blog](https://the-refinery.io/blog/walkthrough-of-a-google-lighthouse-report).

The ideal result to achieve is green on each section on both Mobile and Desktop tabs. Hitting green on mobile devices is harder because, in general, they are slower than desktops, but mobiles are the most used devices in the world, this is a compelling reason to put all you efforts to reach green on those sections.

Google is helping use to achieve the best performance for our website, immediately after the scores we will find the  **Opportunities** and **Diagnostics** sections that provides the necessary changes we need to apply in order to fix the scores.
